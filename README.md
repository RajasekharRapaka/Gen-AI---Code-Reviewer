The Gen AI App - AI Code Reviewer is a Streamlit web application that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to assist users in reviewing Python code. The project aims to provide an intuitive interface where users can input Python code snippets, and the AI model will analyze the code, identify errors, and provide corrected code along with explanations for the detected issues.

Key features of the project include:

Input Interface: Users can enter Python code snippets into a text area within the web application.
Error Detection: The AI model analyzes the input code to identify common errors such as syntax issues, logical errors, or potential bugs.
Code Correction: After analyzing the code, the AI model suggests corrected versions of the code, addressing the identified issues.
Explanation: Along with the corrected code, the AI model provides explanations for the detected errors, helping users understand the reasoning behind the suggested changes.
User-Friendly Experience: The Streamlit interface offers a clean and user-friendly experience, making it easy for users to interact with the AI code reviewer.
Overall, the Gen AI App - AI Code Reviewer aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of code review processes by leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to assist developers in identifying and fixing errors in their Python code.
